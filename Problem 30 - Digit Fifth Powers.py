Project: Project Euler - Problem 30: Digit Fifth Powers
Author: Mandeep Bhutani
Date: 3/29/2015

Problem: Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the
sum of fourth powers of their digits: 1634, 8208, and 9474. As 1 = 1^4, it is
not included. The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316. Find the
sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their
digits.
