Project: Project Euler - Problem 15: Lattice Paths
Author: Mandeep Bhutani
Date: 10/25/2016

Problem: Starting in the top left corner of a 2 x 2 grid, and only being able
to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right
corner. How many such routes are there through a 20 x 20 grid?
