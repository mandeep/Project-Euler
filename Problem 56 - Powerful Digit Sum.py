Project: Project Euler - Problem 56: Powerful Digit Sum

Date: 3/12/2015

Problem: A googol 10^100 is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred
zeros; 100^100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros.
Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.
maximum digital sum?
