Title: Project Euler - Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
Author: Mandeep Bhutani

Problem: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will
be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence
whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
"""
a, b = 0, 1  # Setting the beginning of the Fibonnaci sequence to 0, 1.
total = 0
while a <= 4000000:
    if a % 2 == 0:
        total += a
    a, b = b, a + b  # Creating a tuple with the values (b, a + b)
    # Once a = 0 is added to the total, the variables' values
    # are changed to find the next number in the series.
    # This repeats until the generator reaches 4,000,000.
print total
